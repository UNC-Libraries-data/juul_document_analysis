# Text Analysis Resources for JUUL Industry Documents
Created by [University Libraries at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](http://library.unc.eud/data/) in collaboration with [Industry Documents Library at University of California San Francisco](https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/). To access the Jupyter Notebooks we use for our tutorials, visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries-data/juul_document_analysis).

We have also created a [Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5395305/juul_proj_docs/library) with resources for text analysis methodology on similar collections that may serve as background reading for your text analysis project.
